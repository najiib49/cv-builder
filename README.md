# CV Builder App

A simple and interactive **CV Builder** built with **React**. This app allows users to create and preview their CV in real time by filling out personal, educational, and practical experience information.

This project was created as part of a learning exercise to practice **state management**, **props**, **component structure**, and **form handling** in React.

## Features

- Add and display **general information** (Name, Email, Phone Number)  
- Add and display **educational experience** (School Name, Title of Study, Date of Study)  
- Add and display **practical experience** (Company Name, Position Title, Responsibilities, Date From-To)  
- **Edit and submit** functionality for each section:
  - Submit displays the information in a formatted view
  - Edit switches back to input mode with existing values pre-filled
- Clean and structured component-based architecture
- Basic styling with modular CSS

## Concepts Practiced

- React functional components and state (`useState`)  
- Passing data via **props**  
- Conditional rendering (form vs. display view)  
- Project structuring with `components` and `styles` directories

## Live Demo
TBD

## Upcoming in Version 2

- Ability to add multiple experiences dynamically
- Improved layout and styling
- Handling and validating form input  
- Optional sections (e.g., Skills, Projects)
